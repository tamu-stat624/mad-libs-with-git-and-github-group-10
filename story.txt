Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear mahesh babu,

I am writing to you from a fat spaceship in a chubby galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a pink rocket in september. There are 3.14 mosquitoes and data of math here! In the
women's restroom there is a pool full of Bean Juice. I fall asleep each night on a tall bed of
hemp and dream of hiking quickly. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
